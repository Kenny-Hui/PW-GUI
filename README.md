PW-GUI is a tool designed to simplify modpack management by providing a graphical interface around the command-line tool [packwiz](https://packwiz.infra.link).

The end goal is that newcomers should be able to get started authoring their own Minecraft modpack with packwiz, as well as offering an overview of the modpack.

## What stuff can it do?
- You can create a modpack from scratch
- You can import a CurseForge modpack
- You can export a modpack to Modrinth (.mrpack) / CurseForge (.zip) format
- You can preview various files in the modpack and modify them
- You can add new content from Modrinth/CurseForge/Direct URL
- *TLDR: Pretty much most things the packwiz CLI do, just in GUI!*

### What (more) stuff can it do?
- In-app downloading of the packwiz executable
- Edit preserve state of each file (Whether the file should be overriden by players)
- Mark mod as optional, pinned, as well as modifying different "sides"
- Interactive manual download for blocked CurseForge mod
- gitignore and packwizignore preview
