## Roadmap
PW-GUI is considered finish for the most part (Albeit with some slight UX inconvenience). However, the following thing is also nice to have:

- ~~Add new contents from GitHub~~ (Upstream implementation is not mature enough to be considered useful)
- Git Integration
- More detailed/non-technical descriptions of different features for newcomers.
- Content browser for Modrinth/CurseForge
- A better file picker (???) (The one swing uses is mildly annoying to use)

These will be done in no particular order nor deadline (and might not even be done if it isn't a highly requested feature).

If you have any other ideas or would like to bring some of the above items to light, please make sure to open an [issue](https://github.com/Kenny-Hui/PW-GUI/issues) about it!
